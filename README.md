Hack The Box - Writeups
***DISCLAIMER***

I am not IppSEC nor do I work with him or for him. This write up is simply to be used as a learning tool only. Some people learn from videos and others from reading, and some both. Please forgive any typos. These write ups are to get you familiar with the types of tools used for penetration testing and how to utulize them.

These write ups are not verbatium, they are the steps taken to gain root, along with a few additional resources.
